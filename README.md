This project report presents the design and implementation of a hotel management system aimed 
at automating and optimizing guest room operations. The system features a scalable three-tier 
architecture and integrates essential functionalities including secure user login and registration, 
room inventory management, categorization of room types, dynamic pricing strategies etc. It 
streamlines reservation processes, enhances employee management, and facilitates efficient 
check-in/check-out procedures. Additionally, the system supports automated billing and invoicing, 
and includes parking management to improve guest services. A robust database design supports 
efficient data storage and retrieval, ensuring secure and accurate operations. This system 
empowers hotel staff to manage operations seamlessly, leading to increased productivity and 
enhanced guest satisfaction. Through the adoption of this system, hotels can achieve modernized 
and efficient management, aligning with contemporary business demands and guest 
expectations.
